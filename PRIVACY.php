            <p id="p-seven"> Dawgs & KITTY Adoption Center promises to never release or sell or misuse anyone's personal
                information,
                and we securely protect all information given to us. We also protect the website builder from any
                incorrect information posted by a pet owner.
                If any information get leaked, and we did not realize it, make sure to contact us immediately, and we
                will do our best to rectify the situation.
                We have the right to deny any adoption request we do not see fit or with missing information. If you are
                unhappy with our decision make sure to
                contact us quickly, and we will try to find a way to fix the situation. There is a possibility of a wait
                list for certain pets, we will send an email
                if the pet was already adopted by someone else. All of our pets are vaccinated and spayed if they are
                over the age of one. We will not allow the adoption
                family to pick up the pet to bring home if it is under the age of one, but they have visitation right,
                we simply think it is too early to separate it from it's mother.
                Bonded pairs are pets that HAVE to be adopted together, because they have spent their whole life
                together and separating them would simply be torture
                and these pets are usually inseparable.<br> Thank you for you understanding
